# ROLAND TUBOLY

I am a Social Data Science Master's student with an interest in Machine Learning, LLMs and Network Science, currently based in Budapest, Hungary.

I enjoy working on:

- Linking urban form and public transport topology to access and opportunities
- Measuring segregation and fragmentation in counties using national data
- Building reproducible analyses on football-related and musical data

## What I know and use

- Programming languages: Python, R
- Tools: Git, Jupyter, VS Code, Microsoft Excel
- Topics: statistics, machine learning basics, network analysis

I treat this list as a snapshot of what I am actually using, not everything I have ever touched.

## Highlighted repositories

- [repo-1](https://github.com/USER/repo-1)  
  Short description of the project, the data or problem, and the main result.

- [repo-2](https://github.com/USER/repo-2)  
  Short description focused on what you implemented (for example: wrote the data pipeline, implemented the model, built the frontend).

- [Network Analysis project](https://github.com/KrisX03/Differences-between-Hungarian-counties)  
  Course project, where we studied the industrial structure of two geographically distant Hungarian counties - Győr-Moson-Sopron and Hajdú-Bihar - using network-analytic tools.

## What I am working on right now

- Learning: SQL, interactive data apps with Shiny and Streamlit
- Building: small reproducible projects on network robustness, diffusion, and urban inequality using open data
- Improving: better version control workflows
